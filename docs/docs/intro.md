## What is gSwap?

gSwap is a high-performance decentralized exchange built on GalaChain, offering:

- **Fast & Low-Cost Trading** - Near-instant transactions with minimal, consistent fees
- **Secure** - Industry leading mitigation against MEV attacks
- **Ease of Use** - gSwap is built on GalaChain and many blockchain concepts such as gas fees are simplified

## Quick Example

```typescript
import { GSwap, PrivateKeySigner } from '@gala-chain/gswap-sdk';

const gSwap = new GSwap({
  signer: new PrivateKeySigner('your-private-key'),
});

const USDC_SELLING_AMOUNT = 10; // Amount of USDC to sell

// Quote how much $GALA you can get for 10 USDC
const quote = await gSwap.quoting.quoteExactInput(
  'GUSDC|Unit|none|none', // Token to sell
  'GALA|Unit|none|none', // Token to buy
  USDC_SELLING_AMOUNT,
);

// Execute a swap using the fee tier from the quote
const transaction = await gSwap.swaps.swap(
  'GUSDC|Unit|none|none', // Token to sell
  'GALA|Unit|none|none', // Token to buy
  quote.feeTier, // Use the fee tier from the quote
  {
    exactIn: USDC_SELLING_AMOUNT,
    amountOutMinimum: quote.outTokenAmount.multipliedBy(0.95), // 5% slippage
  },
  'eth|123...abc', // your wallet address
);
```
